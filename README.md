# NiLeMProject
Welcome to the Nikiforov's Learning Machine (NiLeM) Project!

## Explanation
What the NiLeM project is?
Primary goal of this project is to make learning (using electronics) much easier.
This project has two main parts: NiLeM and NiLeSh.

### NiLeSh
A bit of humor was needed to choose the NiLeSh (Nikiforov's Learning Shell) name for this part of the work.
NiLeSh is a Python program. It is used to run some peaces of text made to change NiLeM.
These peaces of text must be written in NiLeSh language.
The language is simple and writers do not need to know how does the result in JavaScript look.
Yes, NiLeSh engine turns these simple programs into a lot more complicated JavaScript scripts.
It is the heart of this project. All the NiLeM is made using NiLeSh, because NiLeSh makes it absolutely easy!

### NiLeM
It is the final result of the work.
This part contains .html files with a lot of JavaScript. Every file is a lesson (or a menu).
Lessons show explanation of the topic and questions to the user. And the user can read and answer.
Anyone can help learners by adding something new to NiLeM (using NiLeSh).
NiLeSh can be used by anyone, but it will always do NiLeM.
NiLeM is the thing, that can be used by many, many, many users. For example, by You.
You don't need to understand programming, You just need to launch the NeLeM and it will take You to the world of learning.
The only question is: Is there enough of everything?

## How to use?
This project is made for everyone. Feel free to download and use in any ways.
I will be happy to know, that it is useful.

To use for education, just download it and run one of the .html files from the NiLeM folder in Your browser.
It is really intuitive and easy to understand!
For longer explanation, how to use it, You can check manual.

And feel free to make a work based on this one. It is here for You.

## How to participate?
Good at something, have some free time and want to do something useful?
Everyone is welcome!
You can help people by teaching them useful things.
Want to have your own version of NiLeM and NiLeSh?
Act as You want, NiLeM gives You no limits!
If You are interested in doing something with NiLeM, manual provides some useful info. You can check it, or ask me.
