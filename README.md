# NiLeMProject
Welcome to the Nikiforov's Learning Machine (NiLeM) Project!
Primary goal of this project is to make learning (using electronics) much easier.
This project has two main parts: NiLeM and NiLeSh.

## NiLeSh
A bit of humor was needed to choose the NiLeSh (Nikiforov's Learning Shell) name for this "programming language".
It is the heart of this project. The NiLeSh program turns simple codes in this language into the partitions of the NiLeM.
All the NiLeM is made using NiLeSh, because NiLeSh makes it absolutely easy!

## NiLeM
It is the final result of the work. NiLeSh can be used by anyone, but it will always do NiLeM.
NiLeM is the thing, that can be used by many, many, many users.
You don't need to understand programming, You just need to launch the NeLeM and it will take You to the world of learning.
The only question is: Is there enough of everything?
