# NiLeMProject
Welcome to the Nikiforov's Learning Machine (NiLeM) Project!

## Explanation
What the NiLeM project is?
Primary goal of this project is to make learning (using electronics) much easier.
This project has two main parts: NiLeM and NiLeSh.

### NiLeSh
A bit of humor was needed to choose the NiLeSh (Nikiforov's Learning Shell) name for this "programming language".
It is the heart of this project. The NiLeSh program turns simple codes in this language into the partitions of the NiLeM.
All the NiLeM is made using NiLeSh, because NiLeSh makes it absolutely easy!

### NiLeM
It is the final result of the work. NiLeSh can be used by anyone, but it will always do NiLeM.
NiLeM is the thing, that can be used by many, many, many users. For example, by You.
You don't need to understand programming, You just need to launch the NeLeM and it will take You to the world of learning.
The only question is: Is there enough of everything?

## How to use?
This project is made for everyone. Feel free to download and use in any ways.
I will be happy to know, that it is useful.

To use for education, just download it and run one of the .html files from the NiLeM folder in Your browser.
It is really intuitive and easy to understand!
For longer explanation, how to use it, You can check manual.

## How to participate?
Good at something, have some free time and want to do something useful?
Everyone is welcome!
You can help people by teaching them useful things.
Want to have your own version of NiLeM and NiLeSh?
Act as You want, NiLeM gives You no limits!
If You are interested in doing something with NiLeM, manual provides some useful info. You can check it, or ask me.
