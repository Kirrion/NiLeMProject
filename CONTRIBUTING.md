This project is made for everyone. Adding anything (not missleading and not inappropriate) will make me happy.
But please, do not make changes to the NiLeSh program. Every added lesson to the NiLeM is welcome, but change to the NiLeSh can make it all crash.
Please, try contacting me in case of need.
In case of not knowing the way to do something, check manual.
